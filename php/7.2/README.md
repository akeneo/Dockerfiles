# PHP CLI on Docker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akeneo/Dockerfiles.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/akeneo/Dockerfiles)

This Dockerfile is a basic environment for PHP development and testing, based on [debian:stretch-slim or debian:jessie-slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/), depending of PHP version (see the supported tag list below).

It comes with the following PHP extensions: apcu, curl, gd, intl, mysql, xml, zip and xdebug (this last one is deactivated by default, run `phpenmod xdebug` to enable it).

Extensions mcrypt and mongo are also present on PHP 7.1 and previous versions.

**This image does not contain Akeneo PIM**.
