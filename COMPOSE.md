# Akeneo development and testing with docker-compose

Two compose file examples are provided, both providing two environments, one for development, the other for running behat tests.

- [**The first compose file**](docker-compose.yml.apache_dist) provides apache + mod_php environments, using [`carcel/akeneo`](https://hub.docker.com/r/carcel/akeneo/) and  [`carcel/akeneo-behat`](https://hub.docker.com/r/carcel/akeneo-behat/).
- [**The second one**](docker-compose.yml.fpm_dist) provides nginx + PHP-FPM, using [`carcel/akeneo-fpm`](https://hub.docker.com/r/carcel/akeneo-fpm/) and  [`carcel/akeneo-behat-fpm`](https://hub.docker.com/r/carcel/akeneo-behat-fpm/).

You can of course create your own compose file, only for behat testing for example, or at the opposite to put everything in on compose file and run both apache + mod_php and nginx + fpm at the same time.

## Configure the images

The simplest way to run the images is to copy one of the compose files at the root of your project (don't forget to rename it `docker-compose.yml`).

You can place it somewhere else, but then you will need to change the volumes parameter from `./:/home/docker/pim` to `/the/path/to/your/pim:/home/docker/pim` (you'll need to do it for both `akeneo` and `akeneo-behat` services, and `nginx` and `nginx-behat` if using PHP-FPM).

Replace `/home/you/.composer` by your own `.composer` folder. This will allow you to use your own github tocken when installing vendors.

Create on your host a folder `/tmp/behat/screenshots` (or anywhere else according to you compose file) with full read/write access to your user, otherwise `docker-compose` will create it, but with write access only for root, and your behat tests will fail.

By default, latest versions of `akeneo`, `akeneo-behat`, `akeneo-fpm` and `akeneo-behat-fpm` are used. But you can also choose to use a specific tag. Currently, are available `php-5.6` and `php-7.0` (same as `latest`).

## Run and stop the containers

All `docker-compose` commands are to be ran from the folder containing the compose file.

To start your containers, just run:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the containers, run:

```bash
$ docker-compose stop
```

but if you want to completely remove everything (containers, networks and volumes), then run:

```bash
$ docker-compose down -v
```

## Configure Akeneo PIM 

First, make sure that Akeneo database settings are as the containers expect them:

```yaml
# /host/path/to/you/pim/app/config/parameters.yml
parameters:
    database_driver: pdo_mysql
    database_host: mysql
    database_port: null
    database_name: akeneo_pim
    database_user: akeneo_pim
    database_password: akeneo_pim
    locale: en
    secret: ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt
```

```yaml
# /host/path/to/you/pim/app/config/parameters_test.yml
parameters:
    database_driver: pdo_mysql
    database_host: mysql-behat
    database_port: null
    database_name: akeneo_pim
    database_user: akeneo_pim
    database_password: akeneo_pim
    locale: en
    secret: ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt
    installer_data: PimInstallerBundle:minimal
```

Don't forget to configure MongoDB, if needed, by activating the `DoctrineMongoDBBundle` in `app/AppKernel.php`, and by adding the following to your parameters:

```yaml
# /host/path/to/you/pim/app/config/parameters.yml and parameters.yml.dist to avoid removal on "composer update"
parameters:
    ...
    pim_catalog_product_storage_driver: doctrine/mongodb-odm
    mongodb_server: 'mongodb://mongodb:27017'
    mongodb_database: akeneo_pim
```

```yaml
# /host/path/to/you/pim/app/config/parameters_test.yml
parameters:
    ...
    pim_catalog_product_storage_driver: doctrine/mongodb-odm
    mongodb_server: 'mongodb://mongodb-behat:27017'
    mongodb_database: akeneo_pim
```

Then you can initialize Akeneo with these commands:

```bash
$ docker-compose exec akeneo php -d memory_limit=-1 /usr/local/bin/composer update --ignore-platform-reqs
$ docker-compose exec akeneo pim-initialize

$ docker-compose exec akeneo-behat php -d memory_limit=-1 /usr/local/bin/composer update --ignore-platform-reqs
$ docker-compose exec akeneo-behat pim-initialize
```

You should now be able to access Akeneo development environment from your host through `http://localhost:8080/` and behat environment through `http://localhost:8081/` (of course, you can change the host port in the compose file).

To access Akeneo in dev mode, through `http://localhost:8080/app_dev.php`, don't forget to comment the `if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'])` condition in `web/app_dev.php`.

## Run behat tests

The tests are to be run inside the containers. Start by configuring Behat:

```yaml
# /host/path/to/your/pim/behat.yml
default:
    paths:
        features: features
    context:
        class:  Context\FeatureContext
        parameters:
            base_url: 'http://akeneo-behat/'
            timeout: 10000
            window_width: 1280
            window_height: 1024
    extensions:
        Behat\MinkExtension\Extension:
            default_session: symfony2
            show_cmd: chromium-browser %s
            selenium2:
                wd_host: 'http://selenium:4444/wd/hub'
            base_url: 'http://akeneo-behat/'
            files_path: 'features/Context/fixtures/'
        Behat\Symfony2Extension\Extension:
            kernel:
                env: behat
                debug: false
        SensioLabs\Behat\PageObjectExtension\Extension: ~
```

You are now able to run behat tests with:

```bash
$ docker-compose exec akeneo-behat bin/behat features/path/to/scenario
```

## What if?

### I want to see my tests running

The docker image `selenium/standalone-firefox-debug` comes with a VNC server in it. You need a VNC client, and to connect to `localhost:5900`. You will then be able to see you browser and your tests running in it!

### I don't want to see my tests running

It is the default behavior, but in this case, you don't need to have a VNC server in your selenium container.

You can achieve that simply by replacing the image `selenium/standalone-firefox-debug` by `selenium/standalone-firefox`. The first is based on the second, simply adding the VNC server.

Don't forget to also remove the binding on port 5900, now useless as `selenium/standalone-firefox` does not expose it.
 
### I want to run my tests in Chrome instead of Firefox

Then all you need to do is to replace the image `selenium/standalone-firefox-debug` by `selenium/standalone-chrome-debug` (or `selenium/standalone-chrome` if you don't want to see the browser in action).
