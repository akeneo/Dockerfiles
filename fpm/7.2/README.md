# PHP FPM on Docker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akeneo/Dockerfiles.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/akeneo/Dockerfiles)

This Dockerfile is a basic environment for PHP development, providing a preconfigured FastCGI Process Manager (FPM).

It is based on [akeneo/php](https://hub.docker.com/r/akeneo/php), and comes with the following PHP extensions: apcu, curl, gd, intl, mysql, xml, zip, and xdebug (this last one is deactivated by default, run `phpenmod xdebug` and restart Apache to enable it).

Extensions mcrypt and mongo are also present on PHP 7.1 and previous versions.

It is intended to be used [httpd](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd) with FCGI enable or [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx). The PHP FPM daemon is configured with "docker" as user and group, and listens to the port `9001`.

**This image does not contain Akeneo PIM**.
